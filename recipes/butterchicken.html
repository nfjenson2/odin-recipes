    <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>

    <img src="./butterchicken.jpg">

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Butter chicken is a great, ever-evolving, cross-continental dish found in Delhi, London, New York, Perth and most
        points in between. In its purest form, it is yogurt-and-spice-marinated chicken dressed in a velvety red bath
        comprising butter, onions, ginger and tomatoes scented with garam masala, cumin and turmeric, with a cinnamon
        tang. This version was adapted from Amandeep Sharma, a young kitchen hand at the restaurant Attica, in
        Melbourne, Australia, who used to make it for staff meal. It is wildly luxurious. Serve with basmati rice and
        mango chutney, with papadums or naan if you can find them, with extra rice if you cannot. —Sam Sifton

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the yogurt, lemon juice, turmeric, garam masala and cumin in a large bowl. Put the chicken
            in, and coat with the marinade. Cover, and refrigerate (for up to a day).
        </li>

        <li>Add the cinnamon stick, tomatoes, chiles and salt, and cook until the chiles are soft, about 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Add the chicken and marinade to the pan, and cook for 5 minutes, then add the chicken stock. Bring the
            mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for approximately 30 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Stir in the cream and tomato paste, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, approximately 10 to 15
            minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Add the almonds, cook for an additional 5 minutes and remove from the heat. Garnish with the cilantro
            leaves.
