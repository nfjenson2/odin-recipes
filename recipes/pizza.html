    <h1>Pizza</h1>

    <img src="./pizza.jpg">

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>First, on the dough: Don't get overwhelmed! If it's your first time
        making pizza at home, just buy the dough. You can usually find pizza
        dough at the grocery store, or some pizza places will sell you a
        one-pound ball of dough for a few bucks.</p>

    <p> This is my favorite way to get a great crust, but it does require
        some equipment. You need a pizza stone and a pizza peel
        (the thing you use to slide the pizza onto the stone).
        If you have those two things, though, you can open up a pizza joint
        in your kitchen! This is a reliable, low-stress method once you get
        the hang of it. The pizza ends up being a bit more freeform, and
        you can make the crust nice and thin, which I like.
        A large pizza cooks in 12-14 minutes on a hot stone.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li> 16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup pizza sauce </li>
        <li> 18 to 20 slices pepperoni </li>
        <li> 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional </li>
        <li> Flour for rolling and shaping dough </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt) </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon granulated onion </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon olive oil </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup softened butter </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone,
            preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is
            nice and hot as well.</li>

        <li>If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients.
            The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza.
            You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.
        </li>

        <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll,
            let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature.
            For a large pizza,I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.
        </li>

        <li>Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about
            1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni
            and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated
            cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.
        </li>

        <li>If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron
            skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat
            burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust
            cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500 ̊F oven and bake
            for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
        </li>

        <li>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board.
            Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces.
            Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a
            side salad.
        </li>
    </ol>
